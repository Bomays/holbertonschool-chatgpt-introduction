## 0. Debugging - Python Factorial

> Fix the code, it should print the factorial of the argument

### Original code :

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
    return result

f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))
print(f)
```

The code has a logical issue in the factorial function. The while loop is infinite because the value of n is not being decremented within the loop, so n will never reach 1, and the loop will run indefinitely.

### Corrected code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
        n -= 1  # Decrement n
    return result

f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))
print(f)
```

Explanation:

Decrementing n: The line n -= 1 is added inside the while loop to ensure that n decreases with each iteration, eventually causing the loop to terminate.

## 1. Debugging - Python Arguments

> Fix the code, it should print only the arguments without the python file name

### Original code :

```
 cat factorial.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
    return result

f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))
print(f)
```

The error occurs because the code enters an infinite loop when you run the script. The KeyboardInterrupt exception (^C) indicates that you manually stopped the execution because the program was stuck.

The issue is with the while loop in the factorial function. The value of n is not being decremented, so n always remains greater than 1, causing the loop to run indefinitely.

### Corrected code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 1:
        result *= n
        n -= 1  # Decrement n
    return result

f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))
print(f)
```

Explanation:

Decrementing n: The line n -= 1 is added inside the while loop. This decreases the value of n by 1 during each iteration, ensuring that the loop eventually ends when n becomes less than or equal to 1.
With this correction, the code correctly compute the factorial of the input number and avoid the infinite loop.

## 2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript

> Fix the code, it should change the background color when you click on the button

### Original code: 

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Change Background Color</title>
<style>
    body {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
        text-align: center;
        padding-top: 50px;
    }
    button {
        padding: 10px 20px;
        font-size: 16px;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Click the button to change the background color</h2>

<button id="colorButon">Change Color</button>

<script>
    document.getElementById("colorButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
        changeBackgroundColor();
    });

    function changeBackgroundColor() {
        // Generate a random color
        var randomColor = "#" + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);
        // Change the background color of the body
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
    }
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

The code provided is almost correct, but there's a small typo that will prevent the script from working as expected. Specifically, the id of the button in the HTML and the JavaScript code do not match.

Solution :

You should make sure that the ID used in the JavaScript matches the ID used in the HTML. In this case, you need to correct the ID in either the HTML or the JavaScript code.

## 3. Debugging - Python Mines

> Fix the code, implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, thus winning the game

### original code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import random
import os

def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')

class Minesweeper:
    def __init__(self, width=10, height=10, mines=10):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.mines = set(random.sample(range(width * height), mines))
        self.field = [[' ' for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
        self.revealed = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]

    def print_board(self, reveal=False):
        clear_screen()
        print('  ' + ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(self.width)))

                    if (y * self.width + x) in self.mines:
                        print('*', end=' ')
                    else:
                        count = self.count_mines_nearby(x, y)
                        print(count if count > 0 else ' ', end=' ')
                else:
                    print('.', end=' ')
            print()

    def count_mines_nearby(self, x, y):
        count = 0
        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < self.width and 0 <= ny < self.height:
                    if (ny * self.width + nx) in self.mines:
                        count += 1
        return count

    def reveal(self, x, y):

                    print("Game Over! You hit a mine.")
                    break
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Minesweeper()
    game.play()
```


### Corrected code:

To enhance the Minesweeper game and add functionality to detect when the player has won, you need to add a mechanism to check if all non-mine cells have been revealed. If so, the game should declare a win.

Here’s how to modify the existing code to include this win condition:

A. **Add a method to check if the player has won**: This method will verify whether all non-mine cells have been revealed.
B. **Update the `play` method**: Incorporate a call to this win-checking method after each move.

Here’s the updated code with these enhancements:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import random
import os

def clear_screen():
    os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')

class Minesweeper:
    def __init__(self, width=10, height=10, mines=10):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.mines = set(random.sample(range(width * height), mines))
        self.field = [[' ' for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
        self.revealed = [[False for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]

    def print_board(self, reveal=False):
        clear_screen()
        print('  ' + ' '.join(str(i) for i in range(self.width)))
        for y in range(self.height):
            print(y, end=' ')
            for x in range(self.width):
                if reveal or self.revealed[y][x]:
                    if (y * self.width + x) in self.mines:
                        print('*', end=' ')
                    else:
                        count = self.count_mines_nearby(x, y)
                        print(count if count > 0 else ' ', end=' ')
                else:
                    print('.', end=' ')
            print()

    def count_mines_nearby(self, x, y):
        count = 0
        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < self.width and 0 <= ny < self.height:
                    if (ny * self.width + nx) in self.mines:
                        count += 1
        return count

    def reveal(self, x, y):
        if (y * self.width + x) in self.mines:
            return False
        self.revealed[y][x] = True
        if self.count_mines_nearby(x, y) == 0:
            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
                    nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                    if 0 <= nx < self.width and 0 <= ny < self.height and not self.revealed[ny][nx]:
                        self.reveal(nx, ny)
        return True

    def check_win(self):
        # Check if all non-mine cells are revealed
        for y in range(self.height):
            for x in range(self.width):
                if (y * self.width + x) not in self.mines and not self.revealed[y][x]:
                    return False
        return True

    def play(self):
        while True:
            self.print_board()
            try:
                x = int(input("Enter x coordinate: "))
                y = int(input("Enter y coordinate: "))
                if not self.reveal(x, y):
                    self.print_board(reveal=True)
                    print("Game Over! You hit a mine.")
                    break
                if self.check_win():
                    self.print_board(reveal=True)
                    print("Congratulations! You've revealed all non-mine cells.")
                    break
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Minesweeper()
    game.play()
```

### Key Changes Made:

A. **`check_win` Method**: This method iterates over the board and checks if all non-mine cells have been revealed. It returns `True` if the player has won, otherwise `False`.

b. **`play` Method Update**: After each move, the `check_win` method is called to determine if the player has won. If all non-mine cells are revealed, the game will end with a win message.

This updated version of the game correctly detect and declare a win condition when the player has successfully revealed all non-mine cells.

## 4. Documentation - Python Factorial

> Add the comments to this code. You should have 3 sections: function description, parameters and returns

### Original code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))
print(f)

```


### Corrected code:

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys

def factorial(n):
    """
    Description:
    Calculate the factorial of a given number using recursion.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number for which to calculate the factorial. 
             Must be a non-negative integer.

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the number n. If n is 0, returns 1 (since 0! = 1).
    """
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

//Get the number from the command line argument and calculate its factorial
f = factorial(int(sys.argv[1]))

//Print the calculated factorial
print(f)
```

Explanation:

Function Description: The factorial function calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.

Parameters: It takes one parameter, n, which is the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.

Returns: The function returns the factorial of the number n. If n is 0, it returns 1, because by definition, 0! (factorial of 0) is 1.

## 5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook

> Fix the code, to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), add error handling mechanisms


### Original code:

```
class Checkbook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print("Deposited ${:.2f}".format(amount))
        print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds to complete the withdrawal.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print("Withdrew ${:.2f}".format(amount))
            print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

    def get_balance(self):
        print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

def main():
    cb = Checkbook()
    while True:
        action = input("What would you like to do? (deposit, withdraw, balance, exit): ")
        if action.lower() == 'exit':
            break
        elif action.lower() == 'deposit':
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: $"))
            cb.deposit(amount)
        elif action.lower() == 'withdraw':
            amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: $"))
            cb.withdraw(amount)
        elif action.lower() == 'balance':
            cb.get_balance()
        else:
            print("Invalid command. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Corrected code:

To prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input, such as non-numeric values when the user is prompted for amounts, you can add error handling using `try` and `except` blocks. This will allow the program to catch exceptions like `ValueError` and prompt the user to enter a valid input.



```
class Checkbook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.balance = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        print("Deposited ${:.2f}".format(amount))
        print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient funds to complete the withdrawal.")
        else:
            self.balance -= amount
            print("Withdrew ${:.2f}".format(amount))
            print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

    def get_balance(self):
        print("Current Balance: ${:.2f}".format(self.balance))

def main():
    cb = Checkbook()
    while True:
        action = input("What would you like to do? (deposit, withdraw, balance, exit): ").lower()
        if action == 'exit':
            break
        elif action == 'deposit':
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to deposit: $"))
                if amount < 0:
                    print("Please enter a positive amount.")
                else:
                    cb.deposit(amount)
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
        elif action == 'withdraw':
            try:
                amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: $"))
                if amount < 0:
                    print("Please enter a positive amount.")
                else:
                    cb.withdraw(amount)
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid input. Please enter a numeric value.")
        elif action == 'balance':
            cb.get_balance()
        else:
            print("Invalid command. Please try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Explanation:

1. **Error Handling for Deposits and Withdrawals**:
   - A `try` block is used to attempt converting the user input to a `float`.
   - If the input is not a valid numeric value, a `ValueError` is caught, and an error message is displayed.
   - Additionally, there is a check to ensure the amount is positive. If the user inputs a negative number, the program prompts for a positive amount.

2. **Input Command Handling**:
   - The user’s action input is converted to lowercase with `.lower()` to ensure that the input is case-insensitive.

### Benefits:
- The program now handles invalid inputs gracefully without crashing, providing feedback to the user and allowing them to try again.

            print("That spot is already taken! Try again.")

    print_board(board)
    print("Player " + player + " wins!")

tic_tac_toe()
```



### Corrected code:

### Incorrect Winner Announcement:

Problem: The winner is announced incorrectly because the player variable switches before the game ends.

Explanation: After a player makes a winning move, the player variable switches to the next player before the winner is announced. This results in the wrong player being announced as the winner.

Solution: Adjust the winner announcement to use the correct player.


### Incorrect Board Display:

Problem: The line separating rows in the board display (print("-" * 5)) is too short.

Explanation: The separation line should be longer to match the width of the Tic-Tac-Toe grid.

Solution: Make the separation line longer.
Winner Check Placement:


Problem: The game continues even after a player wins, and the message "Player wins!" isn't displayed immediately.

Explanation: The winner check should occur immediately after a player makes a move. If a winner is found, the game should end.

Solution: Move the winner check right after a move is made.

Explanation:

Board Display Fix:

The line separating rows in the board ("-" * 5) was too short.
Fix: Changed to "-" * 11 to match the board width when printing it.
Winner Check and Announcement:

The winner was announced incorrectly because the player variable switched before checking for a winner.
Fix: Moved the winner check immediately after the player's move. If a win is detected, the game ends (return), and the correct player is announced as the winner.
Game Flow:

The game now correctly checks for a winner after each move and immediately ends if a winner is found.
Summary:
The game now functions correctly, displaying the Tic-Tac-Toe board properly, correctly announcing the winner, and ending the game when a win condition is met.
